    <!--Agree button
        I found this cool way to have a check box along with a submit button which I 
        thought would just be a cool little touch to the site. Also I havn't found a fix
        to being able to press submit without checking the box and still having it lead 
        to the thank you site. The thank you page it leads to is nothing special but in 
        the future it could lead to the actual website but i still decided to include 
        it in this assignment just because I thought it was cool-->
