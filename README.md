- 👋 Hi, I’m Aidan O'Leary and I graduated from  Marist University with a major in Computer Science and minors in Information Technology and Cognitive Science.
- 🌱 My Github shows some of the projects I've worked on within and outside of school that were exciting and challenging to work on.
- 📟 I highly suggest looking at the "OS-God" and "Robotics 400L" repositories to get an idea of the software development skills I possess and Speed-Type-Project for my web development skills.
- 📫 How to reach me aidan.oleary.main@gmail.com
